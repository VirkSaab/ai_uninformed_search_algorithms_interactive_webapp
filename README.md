**Overview**: An  interactive  web  app  that demonstrates  the  working  of  four  uninformed  problem-solving algorithms: breadth first search, depth first search, depth limitedsearch,  and  iterative  deepening  depth  first  search.  The  examplestate  space  is  the  simplified  map  of  Romania,  a  southeastern European country. Each node in the state space represents a cityof Romania. The web app also provides run-time resources stats such as number of nodes in the queue, path elements, path cost. The purpose of this demonstration is to visualize the working of uninformed problem-solving algorithms.
